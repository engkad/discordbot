# discordbot

Discord bot. Apologies for the bad programming, my python is pretty rusty.

## dependencies

python3

### pip

discord.py==1.7.2  
requests==2.23.0  
discord==1.7.3  
python-dotenv==0.18.0  

## how to use

edit .env to contain the correct token and server name

go through bot.py and change /path/to/clips as well as any other custom functions

put .wav audio files you want to be able to play in the clips folder and add more as desired
